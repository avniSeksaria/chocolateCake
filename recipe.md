1. Sieve flour, baking powder, soda bi-carbonate, chocolate and cocoa powders on
a newspaper. Put all the ingredients into a large, steel bowl.
Mix well together. Use an electric hand mixer for best and fast results under adult
supervision.
2. Pour mixture into a glass microwave dish. The level of batter should be a little
more than half way up the dish. Level the batter by just gently tapping the dish on
a table.
3. Set your oven pre heated and bake it at 150 to 180*c for 20 mins.
4. Cake is ready when it leaves the sides of the dish and is springy to touch. Put a
knife into the cake and if it comes out clean it is done.
5. It is best if you leave the cake in the dish so you can decorate the cake while it is
hot with a chocolate fudge sauce and decoration as demonstrated.
